2. You should see the app immediately without any login
3. If it asks for login, check settings above

## üîì Make 100% Sure It's Public

If for some reason it's asking for login:

### Option 1: Check Project Visibility
1. In Vercel dashboard ‚Üí Your Project ‚Üí **Settings** ‚Üí **General**
2. Scroll to **"Deployment Protection"**
3. Make sure it's set to **"Only Preview Deployments"** or **"Disabled"**
4. **Production deployments** should always be public

### Option 2: Remove Protection
1. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **"Deployment Protection"**
2. Toggle OFF any protection for **Production** branch
3. Keep it only for preview branches if needed

### Option 3: Check Team Settings (If Using Team)

## üåç Your Public URL

After deployment, your app will be available at:
- **Production URL:** `https://halloween-facial-detection.vercel.app`
- **Custom Domain (Optional):** You can add your own domain in Settings

**Share this URL with anyone** - they can access it directly without any login!

---

## üì± Camera Permissions on Mobile

**Important:** When users visit on mobile, they will see a browser prompt asking for camera permission. This is normal and required for the app to work.

### User Steps:
1. Visit the URL
2. Browser asks: **"Allow camera access?"**
3. Click **"Allow"**
4. App starts working!

This is **NOT** a login - it's just the browser asking permission to use the camera.

## üîß Troubleshooting

### "Site asks me to login to Vercel"
- You're probably accessing the Vercel dashboard, not your app
- Make sure you're visiting: `your-app-name.vercel.app` (NOT `vercel.com/yourname/project`)

### "Camera not working"
- User needs to allow camera permission
- Works on HTTPS only (Vercel provides this automatically)
- Some browsers block camera on certain networks

### "Models not loading"
- The model files are large (~5MB total)
- First load might take 5-10 seconds
- Check that all files in `public/models/` are committed to Git

### "Face mask not showing"
- Make sure `public/masks/mask1.png` exists
- Check file size (should be under 2MB)
- Verify it's a valid PNG with transparency

## üìû Need Help?

2. Use the direct app URL: `your-project.vercel.app`
